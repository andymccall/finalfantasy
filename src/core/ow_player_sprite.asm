;;    Draws the mapman sprite for the player.  Handles animations
;;  and vehicle changes as well.

;;  IN:  Y = current vehicle.  ('vehicle' var in RAM is not used by this routine -- this
;;                               is so standard maps can override it)
;;
;;    Note that this routine branches to support routines... so those support routines
;;  must be stored nearby this one.
